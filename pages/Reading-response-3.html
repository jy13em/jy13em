1. The author Schwulst argues that numerous social media websites (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat...etc) are in a business form for their profit, not means for user's happiness. Today we'are living in a world of social media. Even when I write this reading response, there are new alarms on my cell phone. Social media gives us an easy-to-use, convenient "frame" that makes it possible to connect to others quickly. Just like factory prints, we communicate with others by putting our lives on social media. Of course, in these "frames," people try to find their unique characteristics, but they stuck in a frame all the way. I agree with Schwulfst's opinion that the personal website is more important than social media. Making our websites on such as white canvases increases our individuality and creativity. It is better to paint our own painting on a white canvas than colouring on a drawing paper that is already outlined.
