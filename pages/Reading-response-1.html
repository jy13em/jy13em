			1. Lialina thinks it is crucial to use the word 'user' instead of 'people' because it distinguishes the existence of two different class â€” developer and user. She emphasized that users have the right to demand better software, but as technology develope, users are losing this 'right' by blurring the existence of the word 'user'(so-called 'invisible user'). Although I'm a huge fan of Don Norman, I agree with her theory. To us, it is imperative to protect our rights as a 'user'

			2. Lialina argues that to become an ideal user, they need to be able to achieve their goals without relying on a specific application. Lialina claims that people need to be able to "tweet without twitter, like without facebook, and upload a video without youtube" (from "Turing Computer User" by Olia Lialina). She called these users as a 'general-purpose user'.

			3.I recently used the e-transfer function through my bank application to transfer money to my roommate. I had to manually come up with a custom security question for my roommate. I believe that the gap, in this case, was this custom 'question' that I had to present to the system.
