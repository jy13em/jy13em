We consider today's technology as a tool and have never thought deeply about it. As a tool, technology has provided us with numerous conveniences, and some of the technologies have been abandoned as they evolved. But in fact, as Seu said, technology is not just a tool. After we defamiliarize our tools then look back to it, there are many meanings and philosophies in our tools. Seu's idea gave me a deep inspiration. When we take a step back and look back at the things that we haven't seen since we've become familiar with technology, It looked quite different from what I knew.

Slow Death<br>
Is there life on the website? If so, does the website die?

I've never thought that there was life on the website. In fact, I never thought if there's life in technology. After thinking for a while about this interesting subject, my conclusion was that there is life on the website.		</p>

'Yahoo' is a web site that has been used by many people in the past. Today when we ask people about Yahoo, they say it's dead. "Yahoo is dead." In other words, it means that Yahoo was alive before. Yahoo is gradually disappearing into history and leaving a reputation in the past as it becomes increasingly forgotten. Seu's example of a slowly dying website is also slowly dying as many web pages are disappearing. The disappearance of a webpage means that it is no longer needed and forgotten by people. Whether it wants it or not, Yahoo is also becoming forgotten and isn't this another example of a slowly dying website? I believe so.		</p>
